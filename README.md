Background Introduction - Credit Default Prediction

Credit default prediction is central to managing risk in a consumer lending business. 
Credit default prediction allows lenders to 
- Optimize lending decisions, which leads to a better customer experience and sound business economics and, 
- Better manage cash flow.

Current models exist to help manage risk. But it's possible to create better models that can outperform those currently in use.

The typical thought process is:
1. EDA
2. Feature engineering
3. Build a baseline model
4. According to baseline model performance, select a different model to improve ROC-AUC.
